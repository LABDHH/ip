`Improve DialogBox: avatar clipping + dialog roles A-AiAssisted`
- AI helped suggest:
    - How to clip an `ImageView` into a circular avatar using `Circle`.
    - Refactoring `DialogBox` to add `setAsUser()` and `setAsBot()` helper methods with style classes.
- Observation:
    - Worked well: The clipping code was correct and easy to adapt.
    - Needed adjustment: The radius had to be tuned to match my layout.
